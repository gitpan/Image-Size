Image::Size - Determine the size of images in several common formats

Version: 3.1.1 (See CHANGES below)

WHAT IS IT

Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the wwwimagesize
script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and WIDTH tags to
IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to return a raw (X, Y)
pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that output into either HTML or
a set of attribute pairs suitable for the CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.
Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, PNG, MNG, TIFF,
the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM) and if Image::Magick is installed,
the formats supported by it.

I did this because my old WWW server generated a lot of documents on demand
rather than keeping them in static files. These documents not only used
directional icons and buttons, but other graphics to annotate and highlight
sections of the text. Without size attributes, browsers cannot render the
text of a page until the image data is loaded and the size known for layout.
This library enables scripts to size their images at run-time and include
that as part of the generated HTML. Or for any other utility that uses and
manipulates graphics. The idea of the basic interface + wrappers is to not
limit the programmer to a certain data format.


USING Image::Size IN YOUR SCRIPTS

Image::Size has pod documentation that gives a more complete overview, but
in a nutshell:

        use Image::Size;

        ($x, $y) = imgsize("something.gif");

And ($x, $y) is now the width and height of something.gif. 95% of my usage of
this library is in conjunction with Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm:

        use CGI ':all';
        use Image::Size 'attr_imgsize';

        #
        # Emit an IMG tag with size attributes:
        #
        print img({-SRC => '/server/images/arrow.gif',
                   attr_imgsize('/server_root/server/images/arrow.gif')});

Alternately, if you are running under Apache and mod_perl:

        # Assume $Q is an object of class CGI, $r is an Apache request object
        $r->print($Q->img({ -src => $imgpath,
                            attr_imgsize($r->lookup_uri($imgpath)->
                                         filename) }));

BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package now uses the Module::Build system:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build && ./Build test

If all tests pass, then:

	./Build install


You may need super-user access to install.

There is a Makefile.PL provided for backwards compatibility:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test
        make install

This simply wraps around the Build.PL file

CHANGES

Updated the license information to make sure all references are to both the
Artistic 2.0 and the LGPL.

Changed "use 5.6.0" lines to no longer use v-strings, for forward
compatibility with Perl 5.10.0.

Added "recommends" specification to Build.PL to refer to modules used in
the testing phase (there is no "build_recommends" setting).

Added Compress::Zlib to the list of required modules in Makefile.PL and
Build.PL.

Added "use warnings" to Size.pm to make sure it stays warnings-clean.
