=head1 NAME

Image::Size - read the dimensions of an image in several popular formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Image::Size;
    # Get the size of globe.gif
    ($globe_x, $globe_y) = imgsize("globe.gif");
    # Assume X=60 and Y=40 for remaining examples

    use Image::Size 'html_imgsize';
    # Get the size as "HEIGHT=X WIDTH=Y" for HTML generation
    $size = html_imgsize("globe.gif");
    # $size == "HEIGHT=40 WIDTH=60"

    use Image::Size 'attr_imgsize';
    # Get the size as a list passable to routines in CGI.pm
    @attrs = attr_imgsize("globe.gif");
    # @attrs == ('-HEIGHT', 40, '-WIDTH', 60)

    use Image::Size;
    # Get the size of an in-memory buffer
    ($buf_x, $buf_y) = imgsize($buf);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<Image::Size> library is based upon the C<wwwis> script written by
Alex Knowles I<(alex@ed.ac.uk)>, a tool to examine HTML and add HEIGHT and
WIDTH parameters to image tags. The sizes are cached internally based on
file name, so multiple calls on the same file name (such as images used
in bulleted lists, for example) do not result in repeated computations.

B<Image::Size> provides three interfaces for possible import:

=over

=item imgsize(I<stream>)

Returns a three-item list of the X and Y dimensions (width and height, in
that order) and image type of I<stream>. Errors are noted by undefined
(B<undef>) values for the first two elements, and an error string in the third.
The third element can be (and usually is) ignored, but is useful when
sizing data whose type is unknown.

=item html_imgsize(I<stream>)

Returns the width and height (X and Y) of I<stream> pre-formatted as a single
string C<"HEIGHT=X WIDTH=Y"> suitable for addition into generated HTML IMG
tags. If the underlying call to C<imgsize> fails, B<undef> is returned.

=item attr_imgsize(I<stream>)

Returns the width and height of I<stream> as part of a 4-element list useful
for routines that use hash tables for the manipulation of named parameters,
such as the Tk or CGI libraries. A typical return value looks like
C<("-HEIGHT", Y, "-WIDTH", X)>. If the underlying call to C<imgsize> fails,
B<undef> is returned.

=back

By default, only C<imgsize()> is imported. Any one or
combination of the three may be imported, or all three may be with the
tag B<:all>.

=head2 Input Types

The sort of data passed as I<stream> can be one of three forms:

=over

=item string

If an ordinary scalar (string) is passed, it is assumed to be a file name
(either absolute or relative to the current working directory of the
process) and is searched for and opened (if found) as the source of data.
Possible error messages (see DIAGNOSTICS below) may include file-access
problems.

=item scalar reference

If the passed-in stream is a scalar reference, it is interpreted as pointing
to an in-memory buffer containing the image data.

        # Assume that &read_data gets data somewhere (WWW, etc.)
        $img = &read_data;
        ($x, $y, $id) = imgsize(\$img);
        # $x and $y are dimensions, $id is the type of the image

=item Open file handle

The third option is to pass in an open filehandle (such as an object of
the C<IO::File> class, for example) that has already been associated with
the target image file. The file pointer will necessarily move, but will be
restored to its original position before subroutine end.

        # $fh was passed in, is IO::File reference:
        ($x, $y, $id) = imgsize($fh);
        # Same as calling with filename, but more abstract.

=back

=head2 Recognizd Formats

Image::Size understands and sizes data in the following formats:

=over

=item

GIF

=item

JPG

=item

XBM

=item

XPM

=item

PPM family (PPM/PGM/PBM)

=item

PNG

=item

TIF

=item

BMP

=back

When using the C<imgsize> interface, there is a third, unused value returned
if the programmer wishes to save and examine it. This value is the three-
letter identity of the data type. This is useful when operating on open
file handles or in-memory data, where the type is as unknown as the size.
The two support routines ignore this third return value, so those wishing to
use it must use the base C<imgsize> routine.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The base routine, C<imgsize>, returns B<undef> as the first value in its list
when an error has occured. The third element contains a descriptive
error message.

The other two routines simply return B<undef> in the case of error.

=head1 CAVEATS

Caching of size data can only be done on inputs that are file names. Open
file handles and scalar references cannot be reliably transformed into a
unique key for the table of cache data. Buffers could be cached using the
MD5 module, and perhaps in the future I will make that an option. I do not,
however, wish to lengthen the dependancy list by another item at this time.
